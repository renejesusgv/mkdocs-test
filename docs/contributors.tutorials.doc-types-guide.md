# Wizeline Document Types Guide

Wizeline's internal documentation consists of documents such as those that describe internal
processes, policies, and guidelines. In general, it is information
that the organization can reference to solve problems and complete tasks.

Well-structured documentation ensures a seamless knowledge transfer and helps to
avoid single-person ownership of information. These internal resources can fall
under one of the following categories:

- **Tutorial**: Learning-oriented.
- **How-to guide**: Goal-oriented.
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented.
- **Reference**: Information-oriented.

Each category has a purpose and a set of good practices to follow. The following
table provides an overview of the different categories and their characteristics.

|   |  Purpose | Format | Example |
|  ---  |    ---    |      ---     |    ---    |
| **Tutorial** | Learning | Lesson  | How to change a light bulb |
| **How-to Guide**| Completing a task | Series of steps | Guide to types of light bulbs and steps to change them |
| **Reference** | Consulting information | Descriptions and facts | Light bulb catalog |
| **Explanation** | Understanding information | Extended explanation | A text on the importance of light bulbs |

The subsections in this guide include detailed descriptions of each category.

## Tutorials

Tutorials help you complete a task without assuming prior knowledge; they are
beginner-friendly. To write an effective tutorial, consider the following:

- Make the objective clear from the beginning.
- Understand your audience and adapt your content accordingly.
- Create a structure that is organized and easy to follow.
- Make your first steps about getting situated; include instructions such as
  being in the correct directory or installing a dependency.
- Write clear and concise steps.
- Include the results you get after completing a step or action.
- Use examples.
- Proofread.
- Include additional support in the form of FAQs and references.
- Maintain and update.

Ensure that your tutorial is helpful, engaging, and easy to follow.

>**Note**: You can use images and video to aid your explanation, but keep in
>mind that they can complicate the task of maintaining and updating your tutorial.

The following are examples of tutorials:

- Tutorial for [requesting cloud services](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISD/pages/2222424073/How+to+request+Cloud+Services).
- Steps to [set up Okta on a mobile device](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISD/pages/2551251297/How+to+set+up+Okta+on+a+new+mobile+device).
- Instructions to [install Zoom plug-in for Google Calendar](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISD/pages/2550988871/How+to+install+Zoom+plug-in+for+Google+Calendar).

## How-to Guides

How-to guides are different from tutorials. These types of documents teach you
how to solve problems assuming you have prior knowledge. Comprehensive how-to
guides are an excellent companion for products and
services. To create a helpful guide, consider the following:

- Plan and research before writing.
- Understand your audience and adapt your content accordingly.
- Explain why the guide is important.
- Create a structure that is organized and easy to follow.
- Use a table of contents, clear headings, and labels to help the reader find specific sections or content.
- Provide examples, notes, tips, and important messages.
- Use numbered lists to organize ideas and present steps.
- Use visual media to support your written content, not as a substitute for it.

A great how-to guide takes you through the basic process while giving you the
tools for optional enhancements.

The following are examples of how-to guides:

- Guide for [writing a blog

- Understand your audience and adapt your content accordingly.
- Focus on simplicity.
