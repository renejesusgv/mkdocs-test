# SSOT Definition and Benefits

This document explains the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) concept and the benefits for Wizeline in implementing this model company-wide.

## What is an SSOT?

A Single Source of Truth is a place where you store all the documentation of an enterprise.
This model ensures that every team member, regardless of their role in the enterprise, has access to the same information when making decisions.

Even if Wizeline has Technical Writing and Development teams, all the existing documentation exists on different platforms with different access levels.
This practice causes to have shareable knowledge that is not easily accessible for other members of Wizeline.

## Benefits of Having an SSOT

The following are the main benefits of building an SSOT for Wizeline.

- **Find all related information in the same place**:

  - If all the team members store their documentation in the same place and follow the same naming and format conventions, the information becomes easy to find.
  
- **Compare past and present projects**:
  
  - By having all the past documentation, the team can make more informed choices for the present and future projects.
  Marketing can create better campaigns, developers can find patterns from a different project, and executives can have more precise objectives and key results
  (OKRs) available.
  
- **Work together and simultaneously on tasks**:

  - SSOT enables teams to access a document and collaborate simultaneously.
  All team members can add information, and the rest of the team can avoid working on the same file twice.

## Platforms for SSOT

Wizeline uses multiple platforms to store documentation. Google Drive and Confluence are some examples that Wizeline used before.
This initiative does not require committing to one specific tool but having a defined process to access all available documentation easily.
