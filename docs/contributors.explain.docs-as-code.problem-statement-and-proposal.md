This page contains a description of the problem that this project aims to fix. It includes a collection of the real-life situations that motivated this effort.

## Vision of the Project

To ensure that all Wizeliners base their business and engineering decisions on the same data and documentation sources.

## Problem Statement

Having a productive, collaborative, and efficient workplace requires having your company's information consolidated.
That means knowing what you have, where it is, and who has access to it. In this way, employees can easily access the
correct and up-to-date information.

The new value that companies provide is to have all the up-to-date information in an SSOT (Single Source of Truth), enabling companies to do business and make
 effective technical decisions.

The amount of content that Wizeline manages across teams, disciplines, academies, communities, projects, clients, and portfolios is growing at a fast rate.

This situation brings challenges that often put Wizeline at a disadvantage, negatively impacting operational efficiency and creating barriers for decision-making.

Examples of these challenges are:

- Multiple employees contribute and edit content without awareness of what contributions others have made or are making.
  - Example: Wizeliners are generating content in Google Drive, Confluence, and team sites.

- Lack of a system that ensures consistency and quality across information created and shared.
  - Example: No governance or agreed rules exist when creating or maintaining documentation.

- Changes to content do not register, and the systems do not track them; this makes it difficult to track the source of the original document or related documents.
  - Example: Often, you see manual *versioning* of documents (manual copies or the versioning feature of the document), which causes links in documents to break.

- Searching for documents across independent and siloed systems becomes complex and time-consuming.
  - Example: Multiple places to store information with no structure exist.

- Isolated systems can lead people to not knowing specific documents and not having permission to see them.
  - Example: Wizeliners store Google Drive documents in their drive, and there is no standard to store things in a shared drive or structure.
  - Example: Wizeliners store information in Confluence or team Google Sites with low visibility.

- Content fragments within the organization in multiple sources include:
  - Using presentations as documentation.
  - Creating duplicates of documents with minor adjustments.
  - Informal versioning.
  - Having official information in unofficial systems such as Trello, Notion, Evernote, Mural, Miro, among others.

  This multiple-source structure causes the following:

  - Duplication of information.
  - Uncertainty about up-to-date or outdated information.
  - Distributed information in various platforms around original documents and current versions.

- Wizeliners spend too much time following up with coworkers, waiting for a response, and attempting to facilitate collaboration when working with documents.
  - Example: Wizeliners feel that it is faster to ask for information by using Slack regarding documentation rather than spending time trying to find it.

- Maintenance of the information is restricted for specific people and does not allow feedback on the same platform.
  - Example: Google Drive documents are read-only, and there is no option for commenting or suggesting. These documents require the owner to grant permission.
  - Example: Google Drive documents are in hard-to-find shared drives and are not available to all Wizeliners.

## Solution Proposal

To solve the challenges from the Problem Statement, Wizeline proposes an SSOT strategy with the right tools that allow:

- Fast access to information for quickly making decisions or complete tasks.
- Keep information always up to date.
- Automated administrative tasks.
- Governance that does not "gatekeep" users from accessing, but rather guardrails.
  - **Gatekeepers**: An approach that often introduces delays with the chain of approval or access requests.
  - **Guardrails**: An approach that provides autonomy with self-directed checks and short feedback loops.

Currently, there are a few tools that the project can use; but first, the team needs to provide possible solutions to the following:

- Allow any Wizeliner to contribute.
- Foster Wizeliners to start documenting as a regular part of their job.
- Keep information always up to date.
- Decentralize the governance of documentation.
- Propose changes across multiple documents or pages.
- Make contributing accessible for technical users.
- Make contributing accessible for non-technical users.
- Find information quickly and intuitively.
- Collaborate in an async way.
- Make Wizeliners aware of required contributions.
