# Priorities

## 1. Take care of yourself

You, your health, and that of your family are the most important thing. Be careful with overwork, COVID, burnout, and stress.

## 2. Take care of your project

The projects bring the money, paying our salaries and supporting systems like the office, laptops, learning resources, etc.
The project should always be healthy before putting our efforts into the next expectations.

## 3. Contribute to at least one initiative or OKR

Wizeline and the discipline initiatives and OKRs are defined (or tried to be defined) to align and continue improving the way
we operate, the culture, our people, the business, the opportunities.

## 4. Improve yourself

We are in the business of learning. Like in finance, we should manage our portfolio of skills and technologies. Diversify,
adapt, have a strong core or foundation, and may make some high-yield bets. Our industry is always on the move;
if we stay still, we will be left behind.
