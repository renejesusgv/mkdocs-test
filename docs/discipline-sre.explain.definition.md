# The SRE Discipline at Wizeline

[overview]

## My Definition of DevOps

author: Saul Ortigoza

NOTE: this is just a random note I wrote for myself but you might find it useful.

Goal: fast flow, less errors, more focus on value, more quality

- lean manufacturing applied to IT, what.
  the agile manifesto was missing.
- build cross-functional teams to break silos.
- end to end `ownership culture` and of what the team builds.
- create your `process map`, measure it and improve it.
- `automate` CI, CD, tests
- everything is in version control (Infrastructure,
  Configuration, Code) and is reviewed
- leverage the cloud to build more reliable systems, faster
- DevOps is a culture not a role
- feedback loops

Automation skills are the most important:

- automate CI, CD
- automate tests
- provisioning

\*Organizations best practices: Agile, DevOps, ITIL, SRE
