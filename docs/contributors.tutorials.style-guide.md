# Style Guide for Contributors

The purpose of this style guide is to help you write excellent technical
documents, presentations, and even emails.

## Bold, Italics, and Fixed Fonts

Use **Bold**, *Italics*, and `Fixed Font` to highlight a specific
word. The following sections explain when to use which for the maximum effect.

### Bold

Use bold text to highlight the following:

- Terms used in a graphical interface (GUI), examples:
  - Button names
  - Field names
  - Menus
  - Radio buttons
  - Checkboxes
- Terms that precede a colon (:) in bulleted lists.
- Names of packages.
- User input.

### Italics

Use italics sparingly to emphasize a word or group of words.

### Fixed Font

Use this style to highlight the following:

- Command or piece of code.
- File or folder names.

## Acronyms and Abbreviations

This section covers the use of acronyms and abbreviations.

### Acronyms

Define the acronym the first time you use it; for the subsequent instances, you can use the acronym by itself.

>**Note**: When specifying the plural form of an acronym, don't use an apostrophe before the letter "s."

### Abbreviations

Don't use the following abbreviations in any formal document:

<!-- vale off -->

| Abbreviation | Alternative |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| e.g. | for example |
| etc. | Provide the full list of options. |
| i.e. | in other words |
| fig. | figure |
| tbl. | table |
| pg. | page  |

<!-- vale on -->

## Capitalization

The following are the rules of capitalization:

- General rules:
  - Every new sentence starts with a capital letter.
  - Each entry of the following starts with a capital letter:
    - Bulleted lists
    - Numbered lists
    - Column headings in tables
  - The first word after a colon (:)
  - Tables and figures captions
  - Headings
- Title case
  - Use title case for headings and captions for tables and figures.
  - Capitalize the following:
    - Nouns
    - Pronouns
    - Verbs (except "to be")
    - Adjectives
    - First and last words
  - Don't capitalize the following:
    - Prepositions
    - Conjunctions
    - Articles
    - Verb "to be"

## Lead-In Lines

You must have lead-in lines. They are not a nice-to-have item, but a
requirement. Lead-in lines not only create separators between sections
and subsections, but most importantly, they set up the context of the upcoming
information.

You must specify a lead-in as follows:

- After any H1, H2, H3, or H4 heading
- Before:
  - Bulleted lists
  - Numbered lists
  - Example code

## Difference Between "it's" and "its"

The two main rules are:

- Always use "it is" instead of the contraction "it's."
- "its" means belonging to something.

## Use of the Oxford Comma

The Oxford comma is also known as the serial comma. The rules for its use are as follows:

- You don't use a comma before the conjunctions “and” and “or” if your list contains *only two* items.
- You use a comma before the conjunctions “and” and “or” when your list comprises *three or more* items.

## Use of Numbers

The standard for using numbers is the following:

- Spell out numbers that are less than 10 (0—9).
- Use numerals for 10 and higher.
- Use a comma for easy readability for numbers higher than 999.
- Use percentages to depict fractions, if possible.
- Spell out the word “percent.”

## Use of the Apostrophe in Contractions and Possessives

Contractions are typically considered informal writing. It is best to adhere to
the following rules:

Use an apostrophe for possessives such as:

- User's (singular)
- Users' (plural)
- System's
  
*Don't* use an apostrophe for:

- It's, instead spell out "it is."
- Acronyms' plurals, such as APIs and LANs.

>**Note**: Avoid contractions such as “doesn’t,” “you’ll,” “wouldn’t,” “shouldn’t,” “couldn’t,” “we’ll.”

## Use of Bulleted and Numbered Lists

The following are the general rules for lists:

- Use Bulleted lists when the order of the items in the list is not important.
- Use Numbered lists when the sequence of steps is important.

## How to Use Notes, Tips, and Important Messages

Notes, Tips, and Important messages are a great way to convey special
information to the reader; the following table explains when to use each:

| Message Type | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| **Note:** | Use it to convey extra or related information that could be useful for the reader.|
| **Tip:** | Use it to specify an alternate way of doing a task or to provide useful information.|
| **Important:** | Use it to highlight important information necessary to complete a task.|

## Dos and Don’ts to Keep in Mind While Writing

This section gives you quick tips about the Dos and Don'ts that you need to keep
in mind while writing.

- It is important to address the reader as “you,” irrespective of whether they are an end user, a developer, or have any other role.
- Use active voice as much as you can. This helps the reader understand who is performing the task.
- Avoid the use of he or she. When referring to a third person, use the pronoun "they," whether plural or singular.
- For accessibility, avoid the use of the “&” symbol. Use “and” instead.
- Don't use “/” to mean “or.”
- Avoid using words like “shall,” “could,” and “would.”
- Keep the audience type in mind while writing.
- When making recommendations, use *Wizeline recommends*. Don't use “it is recommended” or “we recommend.”
- Don't use shortened words; spell them completely.
- Watch out for long sentences. If your sentence has more than 14 words, break the sentence in two.
- Ensure that headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists start with the same type of word as much as possible.
- Ensure that all the items in bulleted and numbered lists, either end, or don't end
with a period.
- Don't use the word "please."
