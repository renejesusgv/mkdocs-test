# Publishing Guidelines

This guide helps you understand the publishing process for adding content to
the Wizeline Knowledge Center, which consists of five steps:

1. Request writing access.
2. Create a pull request.
3. Review the pull request.
4. Make corrections and resolve comments.
5. Merge the pull request.

The following sections describe each of these actions.

## 1. Request Writing Access

Go to the Slack channel
[#wizeline-docs-as-code](https://wizeline.slack.com/archives/C025M2G2FHB) and
request writing access.

> **Note**: Future iterations of the project seek to remove the need for this
> step.

## 2. Create a Pull Request

You can use the [New Document template](https://github.com/wizeline/wizedocs/issues/new/choose)
to collaborate with the project using GitHub's user interface (UI), or follow
the guide to set up
[Wizeline docs as code](https://github.com/wizeline/wizedocs/blob/main/docs/contributors.tutorials.docs-as-code.md)
on your computer and collaborate using the command line interface (CLI).

Both the UI and CLI approaches result in the creation of a pull request on
GitHub that enables you to add your documents to the site.

## 3. Review the Pull Request

To access your pull request on GitHub, go to the [Wizeline Docs as Code](https://github.com/wizeline/wizedocs)
repository and click the **Pull requests** tab on the top menu;
this action takes you to a list of open pull requests.
Click the name of your pull request to open the detailed page.

The pull request page enables you to explore the aspects required
to merge your changes with the project and publish your content.

Navigate to the bottom of the pull request page and find the [automatic checks' status](https://docs.github.com/es/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).
For checks that are not successful, click **Details** to review why the check failed.

The automatic checks highlight grammar errors, format errors, and ensure your document follows Wizeline's writing style guide.

## 4. Make Corrections and Resolve Issues

Use the automatic checks as a guide to make corrections to your documents. This
review process helps you create good quality content by emulating a peer
review while enabling you to complete tasks on your own.

When you change your documents, the checks run again and the pull request page
displays the updated status.

## 5. Merge the Pull Request

When all checks are successful, your pull request is ready for merging. To help
you with this task, you can follow the steps for [merging a pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)
described by GitHub. After merging, the new content is available on the
Wizeline Knowledge Center.
