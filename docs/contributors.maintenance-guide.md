# Documentation Maintenance Guide

Having a complete and accurate documentation is an ongoing effort. This
continuous improvement process consists of three main steps:

1. Assess the state of your documentation.
2. Determine a course of action.
3. Implement the strategy.

The following sections provide details about each step.

## Assess the State of Your Documentation

Your documents will need attention for three main reasons:

- **A documentation gap**: Documentation that the organization needs to complete tasks and make decisions but does not exist.
- **Deprecated content**: Content that is in use but requires changes and updates to
  stay relevant and helpful.
- **Obsolete content**: Documents that are no longer in use.

You can determine a course of action depending on which of these three
situations you detect.

## Determine a Course of Action

Your maintenance strategy is supported by one of four actions:

- Creating
- Updating
- Deleting
- Archiving

The following sections take you through each of these strategies.

### Creating a Document

You must create a document under the following circumstances:

- When creating a new process.
- When implementing a new tool.
- When sharing lessons learned.
- After discovering a documentation gap when looking for information.

To create effective documentation, ensure that you are following the best
practices put in place by the organization and keep in mind that it must be a
team effort.

### Updating a Document

You must update a document when it contains deprecated content, which occurs under the following circumstances:

- When a process changes.
- When a tool changes.
- After organization-wide changes.
- When a document exists but is missing details or a specific case.
- When links and references are not working properly.

Outdated information can create performance issues and confusion.

### Deleting a Document

You must delete a document when it contains information that is no longer in
use. Before deleting any content, make sure it is not be relevant or helpful
under any present or future circumstances.

### Archiving a Document

You must archive a document when the content is no longer in use but the
organization can reference them in the future.

## Implement the Strategy

At this point you have assessed the state of your documentation and identified
the maintenance strategy you need to implement. For a successful
implementation consider the following:

- Make it a team effort.
- Align your documentation efforts with the organization-wide strategy.
- Communicate the results and make the documents available in an official internal platform.

This is a simple and iterative process that can help you maintain a high quality
internal documentation.
