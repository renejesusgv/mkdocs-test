As part of the Docs as Code solution, Wizeline enforces standardizing the documentation creation process and publishing flows.

This document aims to help Wizeline members with multiple tips on writing documentation depending on their audience, help them deliver high-quality content,
and enables them to publish using the best available resources.

## Documentation Culture

Wizeline relies upon creating excellent quality documentation for projects. The Docs as Code project aims to replicate that documentation culture and
reflect it in internal assets for the company and for every deliverable that Wizeline provides to customers.

Wizeline considers documentation an essential part of the process and not an additional "nice to have" resource. For this reason, this document includes practices
 that help you create more concise, meaningful, and helpful content in your documents.

Members from Wizeline create documentation regularly. To consult the types of documents that Wizeline creates, refer to the [Wizeline Document Types Guide](contributors.tutorials.doc-types-guide.md).

## Creating Content

The content of your documents can define the quality of a resource, which can be a product, a piece of software, a presentation, a demo, among other assets.

Consider the following key aspects when creating content:

- Make your content valuable.
- Use the correct language.
- Take advantage of text formatting.
- Be inclusive in your writing.

The Wizeline Docs as Code project has created the [Style Guide for Contributors](contributors.tutorials.style-guide.md) to help you follow the best practices when
 creating content.

## Writing Process

The following sections detail the content creation process phases that help you preparing your documents and delivering high-quality assets that are helpful
 for the consumers of your content.

### Step 1: Research and Planning

Research and planning are the initial parts of the writing process.
This first phase enables you to set the foundation for the scope of your document. It also helps you to define how to deliver an accurate and helpful piece of content.

In this phase, you define your document's key aspects such as:

- Scope
- Type of Document
- Audience
- Style and Tone

### Step 2: Prepare Your Content

Now that you have a solid idea of the objectives and style of your document, it is time to prepare and organize the contents for your deliverable.

This phase includes gathering information from the research phase of the process.
You can collect your research in a central place and start outlining the structure of your document, which helps you organize your ideas.

When preparing your content, consider the following:

- Place your information (data, links, notes, ideas, and references) in your workspace.
- Brainstorm complementary ideas for supporting your content.
- Draft an outline of your document or a general structure depending on your type of asset.

The structure of your document and your outline depend on your type of asset. To help you define this, refer to the
 [Wizeline Document Types Guide](contributors.tutorials.doc-types-guide.md) of this site.

Wizeline recommends you use authorized mind mapping tools to help you organize your content.

### Step 3: Write Your Document

Now that you have prepared the contents of your draft, it is time to write your document.

Depending on the type of document you are creating, use the tool that better fits your needs.

>**Important**: Keep in mind that drafting is an iterative process. Ensure that the tools you use enable you to collaborate and modify your content easily.

### Step 4: Review Your Document

Wizeline relies on revising content for delivering high-quality documentation.

For this reason, Wizeline's Technical Writing team follows review practices that you can apply to ensure delivering the most accurate and valuable documentation
 to the readers.

After drafting your document, give yourself a minimum of two hours, and then return to perform a self-review.

This review process consists of the following:

1. Verify your document's structure and ensure that you are presenting the most meaningful and easy-to-read manner for your audience. Focus on the following actions:

      - Analyze your word choice.
      - Ensure style and structure.
      - Analyze voice and tone.

2. Evaluate the quality of your content and perform the following actions:

      - Check for grammar errors.
      - Correct typos.
      - Fix writing mistakes.

3. Test your document assets and focus on the following:

      - Test links.
      - Reproduce steps.
      - Verify object names.
      - Check labels from tables and images.
      - Review media sources (screenshots, videos, etc.).

4. Ask for a peer review from another member of your team or a Subject Matter Expert (SME). Request for direct and actionable feedback and suggestions to
 correct and improve your content.

5. Adjust and modify your content according to your findings, your improvement ideas, and the feedback you received from your peers.

When you finish the review process, proceed to the following phase.

### Step 5: Publish Your Document

After adjusting your content and ensuring that your document's first final version does not need additional changes,
 publish and release your document through Wizeline's authorized platforms.

>**Note**: When delivering a formal document, attaching the link to the document in an email for stakeholder exposure is a good practice.
