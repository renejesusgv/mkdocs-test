# Writing for Readers

As developers and team members create documentation, they must consider that their average reader do not necessarily read it thoroughly.
The reader and the writer have different points of view and needs.
As a writer, you must ensure that your audience perceives your documentation as beneficial and easy to understand.

## Tips for Creating Reader-Focused Documentation

When writing, follow the next tips:

- Identify the [type of documentation](#types-of-documentation) you want to write.
- Follow a [good structure](#document-structure).
- Have all the information in a [single page](#single-page-usage).
- [Know your audience](#know-your-audience).
- Create a [One Entry Point](#one-entry-point).

### Types of Documentation

Writers can develop different types of documentation depending on their needs. These resources fall under one of the following categories:

- Tutorials
- How-to Guides
- Explanations
- References

It is essential to have this in mind; the readers can use a platform more effectively by following instructions in the correct document format.
For more information on document types, go to the [Document Types Guide](./contributors.tutorials.doc-types-guide.md).

### Document Structure

Your documentation has to be engaging and compelling. You must create a writing format for your readers to follow. Some examples of structures are:

- **Tell a Story**: Create a path for your reader to follow a linear narrative.
- **Paint a Picture**: Describe everything the user sees and needs in a specific moment. Give enough details not to require an image.
- **Theme and Situations**: Give the reader a scenario and accompany them to the proper solution.
- **Level Up**: Show the most straightforward steps to the user first, and gradually increase the difficulty level.

### Single Page Usage

Create documentation that covers a specific topic. Most readers do not read your documentation from start to end.
Having all the information on a single page helps the reader quickly find specific information.

### Know Your Audience

Just as it is different to write to a family member than a colleague, you must keep in mind who are the people that read your content.
When writing technical documentation, you must consider three main reader archetypes:

- Technical
- Semi-technical
- Non-technical.

For more information on audiences, go to the [Project Structure Guide](./contributors.explain.docs-as-code.project-structure.md).

### One Entry Point

An Entry Point is a page with links to every file and document available for the reader.
Although this is not the only access method, it is essential to have a general overview of the documentation.
This makes it easier to reference content and to know where to find a specific topic.
