# Foundations of Wizeline's SSOT

This document explains the need for automation and governance decentralization on a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) implementation
as the Wizeline organization grows and how it helps to optimize problem-solving.
This Foundations exercise also covers the need for decoupling reading from writing as an essential concept when creating documents.

## Document Maintenance for an SSOT

Having a maintenance system in place means that every document is available to the team members at any time.
The main goal of maintenance is to have all the files updated and in the latest version,
so everyone involved in a project have the latest information at any given time and make more informed decisions.

Just as a software development team requires all its members to follow a process to prepare, create, review, and publish code; documentation must have
a similar approach to make it easier to maintain and update content.
This defined workflow ensures the usefulness of the information and how accessible it can become for all company members.

Different existing tools can accompany developers and writers through a writing process.
The main challenge of implementing document maintenance solutions is to have the team members get used to the process and follow it.
Every team member must know how and when they need to create documents, the conventions they must follow, and the responsible reviewers and publishers.
Most maintenance methods recommend having a supervisor to ensure the governance of the workflow.

## Governance for an SSOT

By definition, governance sets boundaries, protocols, procedures, and policies to prevent collaborators from following a wrong path while working.
These boundaries force the team members to stay on the right track, but they are often perceived as blockers that prevent them from finishing their tasks.

Governance requires guardrails to function correctly, and these are high-level rules that provide ongoing authority for the environments the team uses.
Guardrails can be preventive and detective. Preventive guardrails enforce practices to help ensure compliance and disallow actions that lead to policy violations.
Detective guardrails find non-compliance of used resources, such as policy violations, and help alert you when something needs a solution.

Even though governance actively limits collaborators to not deviate from specific processes, it also brings benefits to the company and its team members:

- Ensures efficiency, quality, and compliance of all the developed products.
- Maintains a secure cloud environment for software development.
- Grants adequate permission levels to team members and service providers.
- Gives software developers freedom inside the boundaries to decide how they want to solve a problem.

The alternative for the governance mindset is guidance. The difference is in the approach of how teams achieve their results.
While governance feels like a restrictive environment, guidance looks to create a path directing team members to take actions accordingly.
Guidance requires teams to know how the process works, teach it to others, and become mentors to ensure reliability.

The guidance mindset is tougher to achieve. It requires teams to have resources such as training material available at any time, having flowcharts to ensure
decisions on solutions, and requires all team members to maintain a positive and supportive attitude.

## Automation for Governance Decentralization and Document Maintenance

According to IBM, automation is creating and applying technologies to do tasks with minimal human intervention.
Using automation tools ensures that the team members do not see the document maintenance tasks as extra efforts and focus on creating software and documentation.

The following are some examples of automation for documentation maintenance:

- Grammarly helps team members to write correctly and to use a specific tone on their documents.
- Checks and linter settings ensure covering the technical requirements of a document publication.
- Templates to look after the style of a new file can be available for every team member.

The following are some examples of automation for governance decentralization:

- Having all the data in a cloud environment.
- Setting responsive, preventive, directive, and detective controls.
- Allowing teams to choose their dependencies.
- Building, releasing, and running is possible, regardless of the tools that the team used.

## Decentralization Benefits for Wizeliners

Wizeline members are experts in their areas.
They are always looking for issues to fix for their clients with a consultor's mindset following an agile approach.
As Wizeline keeps growing, the company must find tools to maintain the development processes running smoothly.
Wizeline trusts on their collaborators, and by following a decentralized model, the Wizeliners can:

- Get to use tools they know without the need for authorization.
- Adapt faster to their clients' needs.
- Use their time more effectively without needing to spend resources setting environments outside the cloud.

## Decoupling Reading and Writing

In Wizeline, the team has access to different documentation tools. For example, every Wizeliner has a Google Drive and a Jira+Confluence account.
Project teams organize and decide which tools they are going to use for their documentation, and they commit to developing all their files in one platform,
even if it does not fully cover all the needs of the project.
By giving the teams flexibility in choosing a solution, Wizeline has started to have multiple sets of documentation scattered through different platforms.
It is not easy to convert a document from Google Docs to a Confluence page, and it takes a lot of effort to do so.
Even if Wizeliners know that they have a piece of information, the tool's structure is constraining.
As a contributor, using the customization features that the solution offers enhances and makes the writing process more manageable.

Writers and readers have different interests when it comes to any technical text. Writers need to explain how a product works and solve the readers'
questions as fast and as accessible as possible. Writers do their best when they place all the related information correctly and use a powerful tool.

Readers of technical texts rarely read the complete document. Usually, they are just searching for specific doubts and questions.
Readers care about having a powerful search engine that can save them time and quickly find information.

Even if they need different things, a Headless Content Management System (CMS) can help to cover the company's needs.
It is a system that can send information and documents through the use of an API.
You do not need to think of the format when adding content since the retriever is in charge.
